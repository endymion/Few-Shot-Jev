# Does Jev learn a classification boundary from four examples?

> A model can recognize a familiar category without being told what a team means by it. A labeled example may make that boundary clearer—or it may add noise, a misleading prototype, or an accidental shortcut.

Jev is often used as a zero-shot decision model: provide a piece of text, name the possible outcomes, and receive a typed choice with probabilities. But its state can also contain related labeled records. That makes a simple and useful question testable: **when Jev is given a few examples of a classification task, does it agree with the task's ground truth more often?**

This repository is a deliberately small, preregistered experiment on AG News. It is not a general benchmark and it does not yet claim a result. The article below explains the hypothesis, the measurement, and exactly what we will be allowed to conclude once the frozen run is complete.

## The hypothesis

AG News asks a four-way question about a short news article: is its primary topic **World**, **Sports**, **Business**, or **Sci/Tech**? The label names are fairly readable, so zero-shot classification is a reasonable baseline. Still, the boundaries are not perfectly obvious. A story about a technology company's earnings may sound both Business and Sci/Tech; a sports story about public policy may sound like World.

Our primary hypothesis is modest:

> **One correctly labeled training example for each class will improve Jev's held-out AG News accuracy over the same zero-shot question.**

There are competing possibilities. The examples may not help because the label names already express the task. They may help at four examples but plateau or reverse at eight and sixteen. They may improve the selected label while making reported probabilities less calibrated. Those are reasons to measure a curve, not to assume that more context is always better.

## How we will investigate it

The dataset is [`fancyzhx/ag_news`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fancyzhx/ag_news), pinned to revision `eb185aade064a813bc0b7f42de02595523103ca4`. We select a fixed, balanced scoreboard of 2,000 articles from its official test split: 500 per class. The checked-in [scoreboard manifest](manifests/scoreboard.jsonl) contains only each upstream row ID, label, and normalized-text hash—not the article text.

All labeled examples come from the official training split. A training article whose normalized text exactly matches a scoreboard article is excluded. No test label influences example selection, prompt writing, or model calls. That separation matters: a few-shot prompt is allowed to teach Jev the task from training labels; it is not allowed to reveal the answer to an item being scored.

Every condition asks one unchanged choice question. The target and examples are separate named fields in Jev's structured state:

```json
{
  "labeled_examples": [
    {"text": "…a labeled training article…", "label": "Sports"}
  ],
  "target": {"text": "…a different, held-out test article…"}
}
```

The question explicitly says to classify only `target.text`; the examples show the intended categories and are not themselves answers to score. In the zero-shot arm, `labeled_examples` is an empty list. The instructions, question type, four criteria, target set, and request shape otherwise stay identical. The actual request builder is small enough to inspect in [`prompt.py`](src/jev_fewshot/prompt.py).

## One example is not a result

Prompt examples are themselves a source of sampling noise. A particularly typical Business article might make the task look easier than another equally valid Business article. To avoid treating one lucky set as the method, the experiment draws **five** reproducible, class-balanced sets of four training examples per class, using seeds 0 through 4.

Each draw creates a nested ladder:

| Condition | Examples shown | Role |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Zero-shot | 0 | Baseline |
| 4-shot | 1 per class | **Primary comparison** |
| 8-shot | 2 per class | Secondary dose-response result |
| 16-shot | 4 per class | Secondary dose-response result |

The 4-shot set is a prefix of the 8-shot set, which is a prefix of the 16-shot set. In every draw, examples appear in one canonical class order: World, Sports, Business, then Sci/Tech. That makes the ladder answer a clean question: what changes when more examples are added, rather than when an entirely different prompt happens to win?

The complete matrix is 32,000 decisions: 2,000 zero-shot requests plus 2,000 targets × 3 few-shot levels × 5 draws. The runner is resumable and saves only the response, usage, latency, target manifest ID, condition, draw seed, and a hash of the full request. It never saves article text or credentials.

## Could the order of examples be doing the work?

Yes. A model may treat the first example as more salient, favor recently seen categories, or respond differently when the same examples are rearranged. The first run intentionally does **not** try to answer that question. It uses one ordering so it can establish the initial zero-shot versus few-shot result without turning the primary experiment into an unbounded prompt search.

Once that initial Jev result is collected and reported, the next investigation is an ordering-sensitivity study on Jev alone: hold the target set and the selected examples fixed, vary only their presentation order, and compare each reordered result with the canonical order. That follow-up belongs before any comparison with other models. It will be published as a distinct, explicitly labeled analysis—not folded back into the preregistered primary result.

## What counts as evidence

The primary measurement is the **paired held-out accuracy difference: 4-shot minus zero-shot**. Each target is evaluated in both conditions, so the question is not “are two independently sampled scores different?” but “on how many of these exact same articles did the four examples change a correct decision into an incorrect one, or vice versa?”

The reported 95% interval resamples both test targets and the five example draws. We will also report macro-F1, per-class recall, multiclass log loss, multiclass Brier score, top-label calibration error, reliability-bin data, latency, request totals, and returned token usage. Calibration is not a decorative add-on: an arm that raises accuracy by becoming confidently wrong more often deserves a different reading from one that improves both decisions and probabilities.

The [preregistration](protocol/PREREGISTRATION.md) fixes these choices before any live Jev request. It makes 4-shot versus zero-shot primary; 8- and 16-shot results remain useful, but cannot be promoted after the fact just because they look better.

## What we can conclude—and what we cannot, yet

**No live Jev responses have been collected for this study.** There is no accuracy table to report and no conclusion that few-shot prompting helps.

When the run is complete, a positive primary interval will support a narrow claim: on this fixed AG News evaluation, these correctly labeled, balanced training examples improved Jev's agreement with the supplied ground-truth labels. An interval overlapping zero will mean this experiment did not establish a reliable 4-shot gain. A negative result would be evidence that these examples hurt under this design.

None of those outcomes would prove that few-shot prompting works in general, that examples cause the effect through any particular internal mechanism, or that AG News labels are the right boundary for another team's task. This is a measurement of one model, one request design, and one public classification dataset. Its value is that the claim will be proportionate to the evidence.

## Reproduce the investigation

The tests use only local synthetic data and a fake client; they make no network or model calls.

```bash
make install
make test
make preflight
```

`make preflight` downloads the pinned AG News revision, rebuilds the frozen selection, and enumerates the 32,000 requests without constructing a Jev client or reading an API key. It is the final check before any paid work.

After reviewing that output, place `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in a gitignored `.env` file and explicitly set the request ceiling you approve:

```bash
MAX_REQUESTS=32000 make run
make report
```

The report writes aggregate metrics to `results/report.json`; live response rows remain local and ignored by Git. See the frozen [protocol](protocol/PREREGISTRATION.md) for the complete rules.
